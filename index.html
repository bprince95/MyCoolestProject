  <h1>Air quality vs. California Earthquakes</h1>
  <img src = "https://napavalleyregister.com/news/local/the-quake-does-not-exempt-napa-from-another-one/article_11676d45-33dd-5eef-b897-a34e5267d8e2.html alt" = "Napa Earthquake"/>

  <p>We believe that earthquake events will cause an increase in carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide and ozone in the area radiating from the earthquake epicenter.</p>
  <p>This hyptohesis is based on a Taiwanese study that found a slight correlation. Due to it's propensity for having earthquakes we wanted to see if this would apply to California.</p>

  <ul>
    <l1><strong>Our conclusions:</strong></l1>
    <ol>
        <li>There is no correlation between earthquakes and the release of noxious gases from the earth.</li>
